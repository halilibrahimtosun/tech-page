            <p>Cascading Stylesheets — or CSS — is the first technology you should start learning after HTML. 
                While HTML is used to define the structure and semantics of your content, CSS is used to style it and lay it out. 
                For example, you can use CSS to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, 
                or add animations and other decorative features.</p>
            <p>You should learn the basics of HTML before attempting any CSS. We recommend that you work through our Introduction to HTML module first. 
                In that module, you will learn about:</p>

            <ul>
              <li> CSS, starting with the Introduction to CSS module</li> 
               <li> More advanced HTML modules</li>
                <li>JavaScript, and how to use it to add dynamic functionality to web pages</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Before starting this topic, you should also be familiar with using computers and using the web passively 
                (i.e., just looking at it, consuming the content). You should have a basic work environment set up as detailed in Installing basic software
                 and understand how to create and manage files, as detailed in Dealing with files —
                  both of which are parts of our Getting started with the web complete beginner's module.</p>

              <p> It is recommended that you work through Getting started with the web before proceeding with this topic. 
                  However, doing so isn't absolutely necessary as much of what is covered in the CSS basics article is also covered in our CSS first steps module, 
                  albeit in a lot more detail.</p>

            <p>Once you understand the fundamentals of HTML, we recommend that you learn HTML and CSS at the same time, moving back and forth between the two topics. 
                This is because HTML is far more interesting and much more fun to learn when you apply CSS, and you can't really learn CSS without knowing HTML.</p>

            <p>This topic contains the following modules, in a suggested order for working through them. You should definitely start with the first one.</p>
            <h3>CSS first steps</h3>
            <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and lay out web pages — for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, 
                split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features. This module provides a gentle beginning 
                to your path towards CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, what the syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add styling to HTML.</p>
                <h3>CSS building blocks</h3>
                <p>This module carries on where CSS first steps left off — now you've gained familiarity with the language and its syntax, 
                    and got some basic experience with using it, its time to dive a bit deeper. This module looks at the cascade and inheritance, 
                    all the selector types we have available, units, sizing, styling backgrounds and borders, debugging, and lots more.</p>
                    <p>The aim here is to provide you with a toolkit for writing competent CSS and help you understand all the essential theory, 
                        before moving on to more specific disciplines like text styling and CSS layout.</p>

                <code>  
                        p, li {
                            color: green;
                      }

            <p>Use CSS to solve common problems provides links to sections of content explaining how to use CSS to solve very common problems 
                when creating a web page.</p>
            <p>From the beginning, you'll primarily apply colors to HTML elements and their backgrounds; change the size, shape, and position of elements; 
                and add and define borders on elements. But there's not much you can't do once you have a solid understanding of even the basics of CSS. 
                One of the best things about learning CSS is that once you know the fundamentals, 
                usually you have a pretty good feel for what can and can't be done, even if you don't actually know how to do it yet!</p>

            <p>CSS works a bit differently to most programming languages and design tools you'll come across. 
                Why does it work the way it does? In the following video, Miriam Suzanne provides a useful explanation of why CSS works like it does, 
                and why it has evolved like it has:
